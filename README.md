## Description
WeatherDashboard is a web application that provides real-time weather information for any city in the world. By leveraging the OpenWeather API, users can search for a city and receive current weather conditions as well as a 5-day forecast. The application also maintains a search history, allowing users to quickly access previously searched cities. Built with a modern tech stack including Express.js for the server, Vite for the client-side development, and TypeScript for type safety, WeatherDashboard offers a seamless and responsive user experience. Whether you're planning your week or just curious about the weather in another city, WeatherDashboard has you covered.
